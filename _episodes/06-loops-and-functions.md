So far, we've used Python and the pandas library to explore and manipulate
individual datasets by hand, much like we would do in a spreadsheet. The beauty
of using a programming language like Python, though, comes from the ability to
automate data processing through the use of loops and functions.

## For loops

Loops allow us to repeat a workflow (or series of actions) a given number of
times or while some condition is true. We would use a loop to automatically
process data that's stored in multiple files (daily values with one file per
year, for example). Loops lighten our work load by performing repeated tasks
without our direct involvement and make it less likely that we'll introduce
errors by making mistakes while processing each file by hand.

Let's write a simple for loop that simulates what a kid might see during a
visit to the zoo:

```python
animals = ['lion', 'tiger', 'crocodile', 'vulture', 'hippo']
print(animals)
```

```output
['lion', 'tiger', 'crocodile', 'vulture', 'hippo']
```

```python
for creature in animals:
    print(creature)
```

```output
lion
tiger
crocodile
vulture
hippo
```

The line defining the loop must start with for and end with a colon, and the
body of the loop must be indented.

In this example, creature is the loop variable that takes the value of the next
entry in animals every time the loop goes around. We can call the loop variable
anything we like. After the loop finishes, the loop variable will still exist
and will have the value of the last entry in the collection:

```python
animals = ['lion', 'tiger', 'crocodile', 'vulture', 'hippo']
for creature in animals:
    pass
```

```output
```

```python
print('The loop variable is now: ' + creature)
```

```output
The loop variable is now: hippo
```

We are not asking Python to print the value of the loop variable anymore, but
the for loop still runs and the value of creature changes on each pass through
the loop. The statement pass in the body of the loop means "do nothing".

## Automating data processing using For Loops

The files we've been using so far, contains 20 years of data and are
very large. We would like to separate the data for each year into a separate
file.

Let's start by making a new directory inside the folder  data to store all of
these files using the module  os :

```python
import os

os.mkdir('data/yearly_files')
```

The command  os.mkdir is equivalent to  mkdir in the shell. Just so we are
sure, we can check that the new directory was created within the  data folder:

```python
os.listdir('data')
```

```output
['US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv',
 'US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv',
 'yearly_files']
```

The command  os.listdir is equivalent to  ls in the shell.

In previous lessons, we saw how to use the library pandas to load the species
data into memory as a DataFrame, how to select a subset of the data using some
criteria, and how to write the DataFrame into a CSV file. Let's write a script
that performs those three steps in sequence for the year 2002:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data into a DataFrame and merge them
new_births_df = pd.read_csv("data/US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv")

old_births_df = pd.read_csv("data/US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv")

births_dfl = pd.concat([old_births_df, new_births_df], axis=0)



# Select only data for the year 2002
births2002 = births_df[births_df.year == 2002]

# Write the new DataFrame to a CSV file
births2002.to_csv('data/yearly_files/births2002.csv')
```

To create yearly data files, we could repeat the last two commands over and
over, once for each year of data. Repeating code is neither elegant nor
practical, and is very likely to introduce errors into your code. We want to
turn what we've just written into a loop that repeats the last two commands for
every year in the dataset.

Let's start by writing a loop that prints the names of the files we want
to create - the dataset we are using covers 1994 through 2014, and we'll create
a separate file for each of those years. Listing the filenames is a good way to
confirm that the loop is behaving as we expect.

We have seen that we can loop over a list of items, so we need a list of years
to loop over. We can get the years in our DataFrame with:

```python
births_df['year']
```

```output
0       1994
1       1994
2       1994
3       1994
4       1994
        ... 
5474    2014
5475    2014
5476    2014
5477    2014
5478    2014
Name: year, Length: 9131, dtype: int64
```

but we want only unique years, which we can get using the  unique method
which we have already seen.

```python
births_df['year'].unique()
```

```output
array([1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004,
       2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014])
```

Putting this into our for loop we get

```python
for year in births_df['year'].unique():
   filename='data/yearly_files/births' + str(year) + '.csv'
   print(filename)
```

```output
data/yearly_files/births1994.csv
data/yearly_files/births1995.csv
data/yearly_files/births1996.csv
data/yearly_files/births1997.csv
data/yearly_files/births1998.csv
data/yearly_files/births1999.csv
data/yearly_files/births2000.csv
data/yearly_files/births2001.csv
data/yearly_files/births2002.csv
data/yearly_files/births2003.csv
data/yearly_files/births2004.csv
data/yearly_files/births2005.csv
data/yearly_files/births2006.csv
data/yearly_files/births2007.csv
data/yearly_files/births2008.csv
data/yearly_files/births2009.csv
data/yearly_files/births2010.csv
data/yearly_files/births2011.csv
data/yearly_files/births2012.csv
data/yearly_files/births2013.csv
data/yearly_files/births2014.csv
```

We can now add the rest of the steps we need to create separate text files:

```python
# Load the data into a DataFrame
births_df = pd.read_csv('data/births.csv')

for year in births_df['year'].unique():

    # Select data for the year
    births_year = births_df[births_df.year == year]

    # Write the new DataFrame to a CSV file
    filename = 'data/yearly_files/births' + str(year) + '.csv'
    births_year.to_csv(filename)
```

Look inside the  yearly_files directory and check a couple of the files you
just created to confirm that everything worked as expected.

## Writing Unique File Names

Notice that the code above created a unique filename for each year.

```python
filename = 'data/yearly_files/births' + str(year) + '.csv'
```

Let's break down the parts of this name:

- The first part is some text that specifies the directory to store our
  data file in (data/yearly\_files/) and the first part of the file name
  (births):  'data/yearly_files/births' 
- We can concatenate this with the value of a variable, in this case  year by
  using the plus  + sign and the variable we want to add to the file name:  + str(year) 
- Then we add the file extension as another text string:  + '.csv' 

Notice that we use single quotes to add text strings. The variable is not
surrounded by quotes. This code produces the string
 data/yearly_files/births2002.csv which contains the path to the new filename
AND the file name itself.

## Building reusable and modular code with functions

Suppose that separating large data files into individual yearly files is a task
that we frequently have to perform. We could write a **for loop** like the one above
every time we needed to do it but that would be time consuming and error prone.
A more elegant solution would be to create a reusable tool that performs this
task with minimum input from the user. To do this, we are going to turn the code
we've already written into a function.

Functions are reusable, self-contained pieces of code that are called with a
single command. They can be designed to accept arguments as input and return
values, but they don't need to do either. Variables declared inside functions
only exist while the function is running and if a variable within the function
(a local variable) has the same name as a variable somewhere else in the code,
the local variable hides but doesn't overwrite the other.

Every method used in Python (for example,  print ) is a function, and the
libraries we import (say,  pandas ) are a collection of functions. We will only
use functions that are housed within the same code that uses them, but
we can also write functions that can be used by different programs.

Functions are declared following this general structure:

```python
def this_is_the_function_name(input_argument1, input_argument2):
    # The body of the function is indented
    # This function prints the two arguments to screen
    print('The function arguments are:', input_argument1, input_argument2, '(this is done inside the function!)')
    
    # And returns their product
    return input_argument1 * input_argument2
```

The function declaration starts with the word  def , followed by the function
name and any arguments in parenthesis, and ends in a colon. The body of the
function is indented just like loops are. If the function returns something when
it is called, it includes a return statement at the end.

This is how we call the function:

```python
product_of_inputs = this_is_the_function_name(2, 5)
```

```output
The function arguments are: 2 5 (this is done inside the function!)
```

```python
print('Their product is:', product_of_inputs, '(this is done outside the function!)')
```

```output
Their product is: 10 (this is done outside the function!)
```

We can now turn our code for saving yearly data files into a function. There are
many different "chunks" of this code that we can turn into functions, and we can
even create functions that call other functions inside them. Let's first write a
function that separates data for just one year and saves that data to a file:

```python
def one_year_csv_writer(this_year, all_data):
    """
    Writes a csv file for data from a given year.

    this_year -- year for which data is extracted
    all_data -- DataFrame with multi-year data
    """

    # Select data for the year
    births_year = all_data[all_data.year == this_year]

    # Write the new DataFrame to a csv file
    filename = 'data/yearly_files/function_births' + str(this_year) + '.csv'
    births_year.to_csv(filename)
```

The text between the two sets of triple double quotes is called a docstring and
contains the documentation for the function. It does nothing when the function
is running and is therefore not necessary, but it is good practice to include
docstrings as a reminder of what the code does. Docstrings in functions also
become part of their 'official' documentation, and we can see them by typing
 help(function_name) :

```python 
help(one_year_csv_writer)
```

```output 
Help on function one_year_csv_writer in module __main__:

one_year_csv_writer(this_year, all_data)
    Writes a csv file for data from a given year.
    this_year -- year for which data is extracted
    all_data -- DataFrame with multi-year data
```

Or, when working in the Jupyter environment, adding a `? (question mark) after the function name:

```python
one_year_csv_writer?
```

```python
one_year_csv_writer(2002, births_df)
```

We changed the root of the name of the CSV file so we can distinguish it from
the one we wrote before. Check the `yearly_files directory for the file. Did it
do what you expect?

What we really want to do, though, is create files for multiple years without
having to request them one by one. Let's write another function that replaces
the entire `for loop by looping through a sequence of years and repeatedly
calling the function we just wrote,  one_year_csv_writer :

```python
def yearly_data_csv_writer(start_year, end_year, all_data):
    """
    Writes separate CSV files for each year of data.

    start_year -- the first year of data we want
    end_year -- the last year of data we want
    all_data -- DataFrame with multi-year data
    """

    # "end_year" is the last year of data we want to pull, so we loop to end_year+1
    for year in range(start_year, end_year+1):
        one_year_csv_writer(year, all_data)
```

Because people will naturally expect that the end year for the files is the last
year with data, the for loop inside the function ends at  end_year + 1 . By
writing the entire loop into a function, we've made a reusable tool for whenever
we need to break a large data file into yearly files. Because we can specify the
first and last year for which we want files, we can even use this function to
create files for a subset of the years available. This is how we call this
function:

```python
# Load the data into a DataFrame
births_df = pd.read_csv('data/births.csv')

# Create CSV files
yearly_data_csv_writer(1997, 2002, births_df)
```

The functions we wrote demand that we give them a value for every argument.
Ideally, we would like these functions to be as flexible and independent as
possible. Let's modify the function `yearly_data_csv_writer so that the
 start_year and  end_year default to the full range of the data if they are
not supplied by the user. Arguments can be given default values with an equal
sign in the function declaration. Any arguments in the function without default
values (here,  all_data ) is a required argument and MUST come before the
argument with default values (which are optional in the function call).

```python
def yearly_data_arg_test(all_data, start_year=1994, end_year=2014):
    """
    Modified from yearly_data_csv_writer to test default argument values!

    start_year -- the first year of data we want (default 1994)
    end_year -- the last year of data we want (default 2014)
    all_data -- DataFrame with multi-year data
    """

    return start_year, end_year


start, end = yearly_data_arg_test(births_df, 1997, 2006)
print('Both optional arguments:\t', start, end)

start, end = yearly_data_arg_test(births_df)
print('Default values:\t\t\t', start, end)
```

```output
Both optional arguments:	1997 2006
Default values:		1994 2014
```

The "\\t" in the  print statements are tabs, used to make the text align and be
easier to read.

But what if our dataset doesn't start in 1994 and end in 2014? We can modify the
function so that it looks for the start and end years in the dataset if those
dates are not provided:

```python
def yearly_data_arg_test(all_data, start_year=None, end_year=None):
    """
    Modified from yearly_data_csv_writer to test default argument values!

    all_data -- DataFrame with multi-year data
    start_year -- the first year of data we want, Check all_data! (default None)
    end_year -- the last year of data we want; Check all_data! (default None)
    """

    if start_year is None:
        start_year = min(all_data.year)
    if end_year is None:
        end_year = max(all_data.year)

    return start_year, end_year


start, end = yearly_data_arg_test(births_df, 1997, 2006)
print('Both optional arguments:\t', start, end)

start, end = yearly_data_arg_test(births_df)
print('Default values:\t\t\t', start, end)
```

```output
Both optional arguments:	1997 2006
Default values:		1994 2014
```

The default values of the  start_year and  end_year arguments in the function
 yearly_data_arg_test are now  None . This is a built-in constant in Python
that indicates the absence of a value - essentially, that the variable exists in
the namespace of the function (the directory of variable names) but that it
doesn't correspond to any existing object.

## If Statements

The body of the test function now has two conditionals (if statements) that
check the values of  start_year and  end_year . If statements execute a segment
of code when some condition is met. They commonly look something like this:

```python
a = 5

if a<0:  # Meets first condition?

    # if a IS less than zero
    print('a is a negative number')

elif a>0:  # Did not meet first condition. meets second condition?

    # if a ISN'T less than zero and IS more than zero
    print('a is a positive number')

else:  # Met neither condition

    # if a ISN'T less than zero and ISN'T more than zero
    print('a must be zero!')
```

Which would return:

```output
a is a positive number
```

Change the value of  a to see how this function works. The statement  elif 
means "else if", and all of the conditional statements must end in a colon.

The if statements in the function  yearly_data_arg_test check whether there is an
object associated with the variable names  start_year and  end_year . If those
variables are  None , the if statements return the boolean  True and execute whatever
is in their body. On the other hand, if the variable names are associated with
some value (they got a number in the function call), the if statements return  False 
and do not execute. The opposite conditional statements, which would return
 True if the variables were associated with objects (if they had received value
in the function call), would be  if start_year and  if end_year .

As we've written it so far, the function  yearly_data_arg_test associates
values in the function call with arguments in the function definition just based
on their order. If the function gets only two values in the function call, the
first one will be associated with  all_data and the second with  start_year ,
regardless of what we intended them to be. We can get around this problem by
calling the function using keyword arguments, where each of the arguments in the
function definition is associated with a keyword and the function call passes
values to the function using these keywords:

```python
start, end = yearly_data_arg_test(births_df)
print('Default values:\t\t\t', start, end)

start, end = yearly_data_arg_test(births_df, 1997, 2006)
print('No keywords:\t\t\t', start, end)

start, end = yearly_data_arg_test(births_df, start_year=1997, end_year=2006)
print('Both keywords, in order:\t', start, end)

start, end = yearly_data_arg_test(births_df, end_year=20016, start_year=1988)
print('Both keywords, flipped:\t\t', start, end)

start, end = yearly_data_arg_test(births_df, start_year=1997)
print('One keyword, default end:\t', start, end)

start, end = yearly_data_arg_test(births_df, end_year=2006)
print('One keyword, default start:\t', start, end)
```

```output
Default values:		1994 2014
No keywords:		1997 2006
Both keywords, in order:	1997 2006
Both keywords, flipped:	1997 2006
One keyword, default end:	2006 2014
One keyword, default start:	1994 1997
```
