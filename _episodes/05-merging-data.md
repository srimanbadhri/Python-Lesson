title: Combining DataFrames with Pandas
objectives:
- Combine data from multiple files into a single DataFrame using merge and concat.
- Combine two DataFrames using a unique ID found in both DataFrames.
- Employ to_csv to export a DataFrame in CSV format.
- Join DataFrames using common fields (join keys).
questions:
- Can I work with data from multiple sources?
- How can I combine data from different data sets?
keypoints:
- Pandas' merge and concat can be used to combine subsets of a DataFrame, or even data from different files.
- join function combines DataFrames based on index or column.
- Joining two DataFrames can be done in multiple ways (left, right, and inner) depending on what data must be in the final DataFrame.
- to_csv can be used to write out DataFrames in CSV format.

In many "real world" situations, the data that we want to use come in multiple files. We often need to combine these files into a single DataFrame to analyze the data. The pandas package provides [various methods for combining DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html) including merge and concat.

To work through the examples below, we first need to load the files into pandas DataFrames. In a Jupyter Notebook or iPython:

``` python
import pandas as pd
new_births_df = pd.read_csv("data/US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv",
                         keep_default_na=False, na_values=[""])
new_births_df
```

![New Births](/assets/img/new-births.png)

``` python
old_births_df = pd.read_csv("data/US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv",
                         keep_default_na=False, na_values=[""])
old_births_df
```

![Old Births](/assets/img/old-births.png)

Take note that the read_csv method we used can take some additional options which we didn't use previously. Many functions in Python have a set of options that can be set by the user if needed. In this case, we have told pandas to assign empty values in our CSV to NaN with the parameters keep_default_na=False and na_values=[""]. We have explicitly requested to change empty values in the CSV to NaN, this is however also the default behaviour of read_csv. [More about all of the read_csv options here and their defaults.](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html#pandas.read_csv)

## Concatenating DataFrames

We can use the concat function in pandas to append either columns or rows from one DataFrame to another. Let's grab two subsets of our data to see how this works.

``` python
# Read in first 10 lines of surveys table
new_sub = new_births_df.head(10)
# Grab the last 10 rows
new_sub_last10 = new_births_df.tail(10)
# Reset the index values to the second dataframe appends properly
new_sub_last10 = new_sub_last10.reset_index(drop=True)
# drop=True option avoids adding new index column with old index values
```

When we concatenate DataFrames, we need to specify the axis. axis=0 tells pandas to stack the second DataFrame UNDER the first one. It will automatically detect whether the column names are the same and will stack accordingly. To stack the data vertically, we need to make sure we have the same columns and associated column format in both datasets.).

``` python
# Stack the DataFrames on top of each other
vertical_stack = pd.concat([new_sub, new_sub_last10], axis=0)
```

#### Row Index Values and Concat

Have a look at the vertical_stack DataFrame. Notice anything unusual? The row indexes for the two DataFrames survey_sub and survey_sub_last10 have been repeated. We can reindex the new DataFrame using the reset_index() method.



### Writing Out Data to CSV

We can use the to_csv command to export a DataFrame in CSV format. Note that the code below will by default save the data into the current working directory. We can save it to a different folder by adding the foldername and a slash to the file vertical_stack.to_csv('foldername/out.csv'). We use the index=False so that pandas doesn't include the index number for each line.

``` python
# Write DataFrame to CSV
vertical_stack.to_csv('data/out.csv', index=False)
```

Check out your working directory to make sure the CSV wrote out properly, and that you can open it! If you want, try to bring it back into pandas to make sure it imports properly.

``` python
# For kicks read our output back into Python and make sure all looks good
new_output = pd.read_csv('data/out.csv', keep_default_na=False, na_values=[""])
```

> ## Challenge - Combine Data
>
> Read the data from the two files, US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv and US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv, into pandas and combine the files to make one new DataFrame.
>
> Create a plot of births by year, grouped by month. Export your results as a CSV and make sure it reads back into pandas properly.
